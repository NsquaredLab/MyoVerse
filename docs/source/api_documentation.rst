Processing Pipeline
=====================
MyoVerse core functionality is based on the processing pipeline.
The pipeline is a sequence of filters that are applied to data objects.

While pipelines can be used individually, they are most commonly used to create datasets for supervised learning.

The following modules are available for creating pipelines and datasets:
