"""Transform system for MyoVerse.

GPU-accelerated transforms using PyTorch named tensors.
Works on both CPU and GPU - tensors provide dimension awareness everywhere.

Example:
-------
>>> import torch
>>> from myoverse.transforms import Pipeline, ZScore, RMS, Bandpass
>>>
>>> # Create named tensor (works on CPU or GPU)
>>> x = torch.randn(64, 2048, names=('channel', 'time'))
>>>
>>> # Pipeline with dimension-aware transforms
>>> pipeline = Pipeline([
...     Bandpass(20, 450, fs=2048, dim='time'),
...     ZScore(dim='time'),
...     RMS(window_size=200, dim='time'),
... ])
>>> y = pipeline(x)
>>>
>>> # Or on GPU
>>> x_gpu = x.cuda()
>>> y_gpu = pipeline(x_gpu)
