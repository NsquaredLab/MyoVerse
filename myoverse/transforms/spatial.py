"""GPU-accelerated spatial transforms for grid-based EMG.

Spatial filters operate on electrode grids using 2D convolutions.
All transforms work with named tensors on any device.

Example
-------
>>> import torch
>>> from myoverse.transforms import NDD, LSD, Pipeline
>>>
>>> # Create EMG tensor with grid info
>>> emg = myoverse.emg_tensor(data, grid_layouts=[grid1, grid2])
>>>
>>> # Apply spatial filter
>>> ndd = NDD(grids="all")
>>> filtered = ndd(emg)
